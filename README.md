## 🧠 Patent & Projects

[![Patent](https://img.shields.io/badge/Patent-US12017844B2-blue.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://patents.google.com/patent/US12017844B2/en)

### 💧 U.S. Patent: [US12017844B2](https://patents.google.com/patent/US12017844B2/en)  
**Title**: *System for Controlling the Supply of Water to a Rooftop Water Tank*  
**Inventor**: Jana Pulak  
**Filed**: November 5, 2020  
**Granted**: June 25, 2024  
**Status**: Active  

**Summary**  
Designed and patented a smart, automated system for managing water supply to rooftop tanks — a common infrastructure in densely populated and water-scarce regions. The system leverages a network of **low-cost sensors, microcontrollers, and relay-controlled motor pumps** to ensure water is delivered **only when needed**, preventing tank overflows and dry runs.

---

### 🔧 Technical Contributions
- Real-time monitoring of tank water levels using analog and digital sensors (e.g., float sensors, ultrasonic sensors).
- Microcontroller-based logic (e.g., Arduino, ESP32) to make decisions based on sensor input.
- Automated motor control using relays, cutting off pumps when tanks are full or when source is dry.
- Fail-safe mechanisms to protect pump hardware from dry-run damage.
- Optional GSM/IoT module support for remote status alerts or control.

---

### 🌍 Global Impact
This system addresses a critical infrastructure issue in many third-world and developing countries where millions rely on rooftop tanks but lack efficient control systems. It has the potential to:

- 💧 **Save millions of liters of water annually** by preventing overflows.
- ⚡ **Reduce electricity waste** from inefficient pump operation.
- 🛠️ **Extend pump lifespan**, reducing hardware maintenance costs.
- 💵 **Save households and governments millions of dollars** in utilities and infrastructure repair.
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **Improve quality of life** for millions by ensuring a reliable, sustainable water supply.

> This invention stands at the intersection of **embedded systems, sustainability, and social good**, demonstrating how accessible technology can solve real-world problems at scale.
