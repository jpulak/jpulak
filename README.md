## Patent & Projects

[![Patent](https://img.shields.io/badge/Patent-US12017844B2-blue.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://patents.google.com/patent/US12017844B2/en)

### U.S. Patent: [US12017844B2](https://patents.google.com/patent/US12017844B2/en)  
**Title**: *System for Controlling the Supply of Water to a Rooftop Water Tank*  
**Inventor**: Jana Pulak  
**Filed**: November 5, 2020  
**Granted**: June 25, 2024  
**Status**: Active  

**Summary**  
Designed and patented a smart, automated system for managing water supply to rooftop tanks — a common infrastructure in densely populated and water-scarce regions. The system leverages a network of **low-cost sensors, microcontrollers, and relay-controlled motor pumps** to ensure water is delivered **only when needed**, preventing tank overflows and dry runs.

---

### Technical Contributions
- Real-time monitoring of tank water levels using analog and digital sensors (e.g., float sensors, ultrasonic sensors).
- Microcontroller-based logic (e.g., Arduino, ESP32) to make decisions based on sensor input.
- Automated motor control using relays, cutting off pumps when tanks are full or when source is dry.
- Fail-safe mechanisms to protect pump hardware from dry-run damage.
- Optional GSM/IoT module support for remote status alerts or control.

---

### Global Impact
This system addresses a critical infrastructure issue in many third-world and developing countries where millions rely on rooftop tanks but lack efficient control systems. It has the potential to:

- **Save millions of liters of water annually** by preventing overflows.
- **Reduce electricity waste** from inefficient pump operation.
- **Extend pump lifespan**, reducing hardware maintenance costs.
- **Save households and governments millions of dollars** in utilities and infrastructure repair.
- **Improve quality of life** for millions by ensuring a reliable, sustainable water supply.

> This invention stands at the intersection of **embedded systems, sustainability, and social good**, demonstrating how accessible technology can solve real-world problems at scale.

## iKormi & Pulak Group — Addressing Arsenic Affected Areas 
### iKormi — *Free Clean Water for the Forgotten*

In many parts of rural and low-income Bangladesh, access to **safe drinking water** remains a daily struggle. Groundwater contamination with Arsenic, unreliable municipal supply, and the high cost of commercial filters create a health crisis hidden in plain sight.

**iKormi** is a **non-profit initiative** founded with one simple mission:

> *To ensure that no child, family, or community is forced to drink unsafe water because they can't afford a filter.*

We design and distribute **cost-effective, high-performance water filtration systems** completely **free of charge** to households living in poverty. These filters remove **arsenic, bacteria, and heavy metals**—some of the most common and dangerous contaminants in Bangladesh’s water supply.

#### iKormi’s Core Impact
- **Free water filters** to underserved areas with high contamination rates.
- **On-site training & awareness** for communities on safe water practices.
- **Field-tested filters**, developed and validated to meet rural needs.
- Designed for **scalability**, with local sourcing and community engagement.
